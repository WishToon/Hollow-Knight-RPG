# Hollow-Knight-RPG
Used for Foundry V12

To use this system for Foundry VTT, please install [Custom System Builder](https://gitlab.com/custom-system-builder/custom-system-builder) by [LinkedFluuuush](https://gitlab.com/linkedfluuuush) as your game system. At the moment the system will be at version 12 until the author makes it viable for version 13 of Foundry.

<h2>What to expect.</h2>
When you launch the world and look into the Actors Tab. You'll see a folder named template. It contains an examples of the character sheet and a folder called <b>'Do Not Delete'</b>. I recommend to not delete anything under these <B>'Do Not Delete'</B> folders. They are the raw templates of the character sheets and items for the world. You'll later come across folders named <B>'Can Modify'</B>. These are used to add new items into the game, just make sure to duplicate them as these are left blank. And lastly <B>'Template Encyclopedia'</B> are used for Quality of Life changes, essentially they are hyperlinks for minor info from the PDF's.
