Used for Foundry V12

To use this system for Foundry VTT, please install [Custom System Builder](https://gitlab.com/custom-system-builder/custom-system-builder) by [LinkedFluuuush](https://gitlab.com/linkedfluuuush) as your game system. At the moment the system will be at version 12 until the author makes it viable for version 13 of Foundry.

<h2>What to know</h2>
When you launch the world and look into the Actors Tab. You'll see a folder named template. It contains an examples of the character sheet and a folder called <b>'Do Not Delete'</b>. I recommend to not delete anything under these <B>'Do Not Delete'</B> folders. They are the raw templates of the character sheets and items for the world. You'll later come across folders named <B>'Can Modify'</B>. These are used to add new items into the game, just make sure to duplicate them as these are left blank. And lastly <B>'Template Encyclopedia'</B> are used for Quality of Life changes, essentially they are hyperlinks for minor info from the PDF's.

<h2>Character Sheets</h2>
In the character sheet you will see a tabs at the top and bottom. The top tabs are the main tabs (Blue Box) while the ones at the bottom are sub tabs (Red Box) that will change based on what main tab.
At the center (Green Box) is where background or social skills are used. Inside the purple box is the Rank of background when leveling up. Inside the skill items follow the default Dungeon & Dragon skill checks, you can change this to what you need.
Below the background section is custom made as well as 'More Custom Pools'. 
A lot of rolls will be automatly calculated for everyone convenience. The main things that aren't automated is the Heart, Soul and Stamina value (for now.)

<h2>Inventory</h2>
This is where the player would be carrying everything. Everything the player holds will be reflected to the total weight on the top left. The backpack is a extra inventory slot but at the moment we can't drag and drop items an into an item. So at that the moment it'll have to be a hyperlink inside the text box.

<h2>Technique & Spell</h2>
As long as Technique & Spell are set to 'yes' on prepared? when looking into the item, it'll calculate how much you can prepared. The recipe list does not effect anything here, it's what the player learned and maybe even craft if they have any stash.

<h3>Side Note:</h3>
When you click on the Cones Image in the Sub Tab. There won't be a image that pops up for in chat. Please download the image here and edit the character sheet. There's a button on the top right of the character sheet called 'Open Template Sheet'. An pop-up will display and click on 'Technique & Spell' on the Main Tab. Scroll all the way down to the Sub Tab and click on 'Magic' Then click on the 'Cones Image' and another pop-up called 'Edit Component' will be displayed. In the area called 'Label roll message', click on a box that has 'rich text editor'. From there you can drag and drop the image, save the edit. Back in the 'Open Template Sheet', click on 'Reload all character sheets', this will refresh the all sheets.

<h2>Charm & Trait</h2>
Charms have the same concept as Technique & Spell, opening the item and make sure it's active. Only difference is that there's a notch count that is displayed and does the math for you. The Bonus Effects dropdown is only for display and give information to the user what is changing. Trait calculation is done for you and the result reflects on the Attributes main tab.

<h2>Path</h2>
Path have the same concept as Technique & Spell, opening the item and make sure it's active. Only this time there are three options and are marked yes when you level up. The book icon on the list display's the whole information of the path, but inside the item you can display certain infomation. The Martial & Mystic Rank cannot be automated as there are certain hombrew Path that let you choose which Rank you want to increase. But whatever changes made onthe total will increase the Max Soul or Stamina in your main hub.

<h2>Effects</h2>
Not everything can be covered so this is a precaution if anything crazy happens. The big difference is the Effect, these will relect on your Attributes tab; and you can increase or decrease stats based on the effect.
Active effects is something extra that can relect on the character icon on the board, this doesn't change anything on the character sheet.
Lastly the table at the bottom. When a character levels up every 2 levels they can spend a point on minor advanements. Its a niche topic that isn't written in one spot of the book, it is spread along the pages as it can also effects Path, Weapons, and even Recipes. Debuff are basic stuff from the book. Damage Over Time is extra because anything can be created, this is just covering the basics.

<h2>Biography</h2>
Basic stuff, used to create the personality of your bug.

<h2>Info</h2>
It's the meat and bones of the character sheet. It shows you the Main stats, Base stats, player size, level items, etc. To simplify things the stats here are static, they only change based on what the size of the bug. And the checkmarks next to cute and Spook are the bonus points when you make a character. The items below are everthing that the character have on them. This is the only spot you can delete the items from the sheet. I'm doing this to prevent clutter and accidental removal.
